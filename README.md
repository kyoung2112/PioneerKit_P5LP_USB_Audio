# PioneerKit_P5LP_USB_Audio
USB audio and PDM microphone interface with PSoC 5LP on the Pioneer kit. For more details see - http://www.element14.com/community/thread/28830/l/psoc-4-pioneer-kit-community-project102-usb-audio-using-the-psoc-5lp 

This version targets the CY8CKIT-050 with the AKM codec board attached to port D. PDM is disabled, and the project is not bootloadable. The project was last opened in PSoC Creator 3.1 SP3, but many components have not been updated to latest.
